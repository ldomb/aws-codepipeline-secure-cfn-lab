## Using AWS CodePipeline and open source tools for at-scale infrastructure deployment

Welcome AWS enthusiast! This projects relates to our blog post [Using AWS CodePipeline and open source tools for at-scale infrastructure deployment](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/using-aws-codepipeline-and-open-source-tools-for-at-scale-infrastructure-deployment/). Join us to build a serverless infrastructure deployment pipeline using AWS developer tools in conjunction with popular open source tools such as: CFN-Nag (https://github.com/stelligent/cfn_nag), CFN-Python-Lint (https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint), and Stacker (https://github.com/cloudtools/stacker). The pipeline will run automated validation checks against AWS CloudFormation templates and deploy the corresponding CloudFormation stacks.

Our main goal is to show how straightforward it is to integrate OSS tools and AWS Code services such as AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeCommit. 

We invite you to read the [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/using-aws-codepipeline-and-open-source-tools-for-at-scale-infrastructure-deployment/) and learn more about OSS and AWS development tools.
